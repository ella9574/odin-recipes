        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped carrots</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>2½ cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup strong brewed coffee</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        </br>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li>
        </ol>
